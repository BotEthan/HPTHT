## Who Are We?

HyperionDev is the largest provider of software development education in Southern Africa, and one of the largest globally. Founded by Riaz Moola in 2012, 
HyperionDev is counted among the top education technology startups in EMEA with headquarters in Cape Town and London. We were originally launched from the 
University of Cambridge, and our leadership team consists of world-leading talent from companies such as Google, Amazon, 2U/GetSmarter, Yoco, Zando and PwC.

HyperionDev was funded by both Facebook and Google in 2017 for its mission. We won first prize in Facebook's Africa Innovation Challenge Award as the top 
edtech startup on the African continent, and in 2020 won the UK government’s Tech Nation top startups award. In 2021, we closed one of the largest Series
 A fundraises in South Africa with nearly 1500 investors backing us in the biggest crowdfunding round in history for an Africa-linked startup. 

We have built an online course platform that allows human code review to be scaled, applying this methodology to help thousands of students from over 40
 countries learn how to code in a novel way. We pioneer effective and affordable software development education with this code review model, lowering 
 the cost of access to tech careers around the world to shrink the tech skills gap and inequality in the tech space. Please ensure you have reviewed our 
 about us page as well.
